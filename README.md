Machine Learning Clustering Tutorial


Introduction
Clustering is one of the most widely applied techniques in machine learning, especially when dealing with exploratory data analysis. Clustering puts together data points into groups, called clusters, depending on their similarity. In general, similarities are defined through distance or probabilistic measures (Brownlee, 2024). As clustering is an unsupervised process, it doesn't depend on labeled datasets, so it is versatile for gaining insight into patterns in the data (Hastie et al., 2009). This tutorial addresses two of the most widely used clustering algorithms:
•	K-Means Clustering : It is a partition-based algorithm it places data points into K clusters in such a way that variance within clusters is minimized. Computationally efficient, works well with spherical or evenly distributed clusters.
•	Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM): This method extends K-Means by presenting a probabilistic framework. Each data point gets a chance to be assigned a probability belonging to each cluster; thus, GMM is more flexible for overlapping clusters or data with complex distributions.
This dataset is 1000 rows by 13 numerical features. Clustering will be used to identify hidden groupings and interpret meaningful patterns in the data (Hastie et al., 2009). These findings can be used as a basis for decision-making in fields such as customer segmentation, anomaly detection, or market research.
Objective 
The main aim of this tutorial is to use clustering algorithms to discover the structure and underlying patterns in a data set (Murphy, 2012). Clustering methods like K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) are used to cluster the data points into meaningful clusters. The emphasis is on determining the optimal number of clusters and comparing the performance of these two methods in clustering.
Apply Clustering Techniques:
Use K-Means Clustering and Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) to partition the dataset into clusters (Müller and Guido, 2016).
Understand how each method assigns data points to clusters.
Determine Optimal Clusters:
Evaluate the performance of the clustering with the Silhouette Score. The Silhouette Score measures how well each data point fits within its assigned cluster. Determine the optimal number of clusters (K) that maximizes the Silhouette Score.
Visualize Clusters:
Plot clusters with the first two features (feature_1 and feature_2) to enable interpretation of cluster separations and patterns .
Compare Approaches:
Compare the pros and cons of both methods.
Indicate where one method would be better suited than the other, given the characteristics of the data.
Dataset Summary:
Data Rows: The data is 1000 rows. This means that there are 1000 individual data points.
Features
The dataset comprises 13 numeric features from feature_1 to feature_13 describing different aspects of the data.
These features are ideal for clustering since they are continuous and scalable.
Category Target Column: The data set contains a target column that is categorical in nature, however it is excluded from the process of clustering since the process of clustering is unsupervised and does not use labels. Suitability for Clustering:
The dataset is completely numeric (after the exclusion of the target column), and hence both K-Means and GMM are appropriate clustering techniques for the dataset.

 Methodology 
The clustering analysis process is a step-by-step systematic approach to preprocess the data, apply clustering techniques, evaluate the clusters, and visualize the results. The following is a step-by-step breakdown:

1. Preprocessing
The categorical target column was excluded because clustering is unsupervised learning and does not require labels.
Only numerical features (feature_1 to feature_13) were kept for the purpose of clustering. This would ensure that the analysis was on measurable and comparable attributes.
 
2. Feature Scaling
Thenumeric features are in different ranges, for example, values can range between 0-1, and for some others between 0-1000. Otherwise, if left unscaled, algorithms such as K-Means that base their computation on Euclidean distance, can be heavily skewed by features that are on a larger magnitude.
We applied StandardScaler to standardize the data. This method rescales each feature so that it has a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1, thus giving equal weight to all features.
 
3. K-Means Clustering
We applied K-Means with varying values of K (number of clusters) from 2 to 10.
For each value of K:
The dataset was divided into K clusters.
The Silhouette Score was computed to evaluate the goodness of the clusters:
A greater Silhouette Score reflects the closeness of data points to their assigned cluster centre, compared to other clusters' centres.
This works for determining the optimal value of K.
The greatest Silhouette Score was the K-Means found to have the best fit value of K, when it was K=2.
 

4. Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)
GMM is implemented on the dataset also within the same range of K: 2 to 10.
Unlike K-Means, GMM assigns data points to clusters based on a probabilistic approach. Each data point is assigned a probability of belonging to a cluster, thus enabling soft clustering.
Silhouette Scores were computed for every value of K to evaluate the quality of the clusters, as in K-Means.
The best K for GMM was also K=2, which matched the K-Means.
 

5. Visualization
The most crucial role of visualizations for interpreting the results is given below:
a) Silhouette Scores Plot:
It compares the Silhouette Scores for different values of K for both K-Means and GMM.
The score decreases as K increases, indicating that a simpler cluster structure fits better (like K=2).
Key Observations
K-Means was found to generally perform better than GMM using the Silhouette Scores
Optimal number of clusters
For both the methods, the optimal number of clusters was found to be K=2.
 

b) K-Means Clustering Visualization:
The data points are divided into two clusters, and for easy readability, they are colored differently.
The plot uses the first two features (feature_1 and feature_2) for ease.
Key Observations:
The clusters are well separated with little overlap, indicating good performance by K-Means.
 
c) GMM Clustering Visualization:
Just like the K-Means plot, this is a plot that shows two clusters formed using GMM.
GMM enables overlapping clusters because of its probabilistic nature.
Key Observations:
The clusters formed by GMM are similar to K-Means but appear slightly more flexible due to the probabilistic assignments.
